The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "diabetes_prediction_dataset " file,containing detailed information about halth performance of each patient.

### Tools 

- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- Python - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Reports
- Machine learning models - To predict whether or not a patient has diabetes

### Data cleaning and preparation

In the initial data preparation phase,we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling incorrect data types.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as;

- Which feature has the strongest correlation with diabetes?
- Which gender has the most occurence of diabetic patient?
